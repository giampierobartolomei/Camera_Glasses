# Camera_Glass
adaption from ESP32-CAM_MJPEG2SD repo, look at their ReadMe for instruction istallation. PSRAM needs to be active!
Gcode ready for print, just glue the cover to the left stick of pair of glasses.
Differences \w the repo:
1) ForceRecord defined in .ino file
2) Recording from Serial input (commented)
3) BT recording start/stop
